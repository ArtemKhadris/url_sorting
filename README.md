# URL sorter
## URL sorting by words in URL and description

Main code in datas4, URLs in harvest_copy, other files - results.
We have a list of URLs, a description for them, and a possible category. The result of the code execution is a set of keywords from the URLs themselves, descriptions for them, and, as a result, a new table with assigned categories.
