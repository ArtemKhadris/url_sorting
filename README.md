# URL sorter
## URL sorting by words in URL and description

Main code in datas4, URLs in harvest_copy, other files - results.

We have a list of URLs, a description for them, and a possible category. The result of the code execution is a set of keywords from the URLs themselves, descriptions for them, and, as a result, a new table with assigned categories.

Original DB contained more than 1kk lines, so I cut it.

Unfortunately, the code will have to be downloaded to your computer in order to check its performance, since it is difficult to execute it in an online format.
